While Singapore excels in smart mobility, it lacks a standardized set of guidelines for real-time vehicular tracking and emergency alert systems, unlike India’s AIS-140. The deficiency poses several challenges in maintaining consistency across transportation modes.
This study aims to develop a low-power, cost-effective Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) device that adheres to the safety and monitoring requirements of the AIS-140, adapting it for both passenger driven and autonomous vehicles. The proposed device integrates multi-GNSS support, real time speed and battery monitoring , followed by sensor health diagnostics and remote control for autonomous vehicles. In the case of real-time emergencies, the device will send relevant information to whitelisted IPs.
The device utilises a communication framework employing secure TCP based protocols over cellular and satellite networks. The device’s architecture is based on an ESP32-like microcontroller, combined with ROS2 middleware and OTA updates.
This research bridges the gap between standardised regulations, technological innovation and cost-reduction. Its adaptability for both passenger-driven and autonomous vehicles offers new possibilities for intelligent transportation management solutions.
